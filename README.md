# üöí Common API Utilities

Welcome to the **Common API Utilities** repository! This repository contains a set of utility scripts used by publically-facing State Emergency Service (SES) APIs. These utilities provide common functions like CORS handling, response management, and sanitization, all crucial for robust and secure API services.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

Here's a brief overview of the repository files:

- **[`composer.json`](#dependencies)**: Dependencies for the utilities, managed via Composer.
- **[`cors.php`](#1-cors-handling-corsphp)**: Handles Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to ensure secure API interactions.
- **[`responseManager.php`](#2-response-management-responsemanagerphp)**: Manages API responses in a standardized and consistent manner.
- **[`sanitize.php`](#3-sanitization-sanitizephp)**: Sanitizes input to prevent security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and XSS.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Dependencies

We utilize a few key packages to enhance the functionality and security of our utilities:

- **[MeekroDB](https://github.com/SergeyTsalkov/meekrodb)**: A lightweight, easy-to-use MySQL database library. (v3.0+)
- **[Guzzle](https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle)**: A PHP HTTP client for sending HTTP requests. (v7.9+)
- **[Monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog)**: A logging library that sends your logs to files, sockets, inboxes, databases, etc. (v3.7+)
- **[libphonenumber-for-php](https://github.com/giggsey/libphonenumber-for-php)**: A library for parsing, formatting, and validating international phone numbers. (v8.13+)
- **[ULID](https://github.com/robinvdvleuten/ulid)**: A library for generating ULIDs (Universally Unique Lexicographically Sortable Identifiers). (v5.0+)

To install all dependencies, run:

```bash
composer install
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### 1. CORS Handling ([`cors.php`](./cors.php))

To handle CORS in your API, use the `CORS()` function to allow requests from specific origins.

```php
require_once 'cors.php';

// Example: Allow requests from specific origins
CORS(['https://example.com', 'https://another-allowed-origin.com']);

// Example: No origins allowed (default behavior)
CORS();
```

The function handles Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) securely by sending appropriate headers. It checks the origin of the request and only allows approved origins. Preflight OPTIONS requests are handled, and security errors are logged for disallowed origins.

### 2. Response Management ([`responseManager.php`](./responseManager.php))

Use the `ApiResponseManager` class to manage API responses with consistent JSON formatting and security headers.

```php
require_once 'responseManager.php';

// Example: Sending a successful response with data and messages
$responseManager = new ApiResponseManager();
$responseManager->addGlobalMessage("Operation successful.");
$responseManager->respondToClient(true, ["result" => "success"]);

// Example: Handling an error and bailing out
$responseManager = new ApiResponseManager();
$responseManager->addGlobalError("Invalid data provided.");
$responseManager->bailOut(422); // Unprocessable Entity
```

This class helps manage global messages and errors, ensuring that your API responses are consistent, secure, and structured as JSON.

### 3. Sanitization ([`sanitize.php`](./sanitize.php))

Use the `sanitize()` function to clean and process user input, ensuring it is safe for use in your application.

```php
require_once 'sanitize.php';

// Example: Sanitize and trim a string
$cleanInput = sanitize($userInput);

// Example: Sanitize and truncate input to a maximum length
$cleanInput = sanitize($userInput, 100);
```

This function sanitizes input strings, trims whitespace, and optionally truncates to a specified length. It also validates that the input is UTF-8 encoded and within a safe length limit.


## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

Security is our top priority. The utilities in this repository have been developed with secure coding practices, and we follow relevant NIST and industry standards. For example:

- **Input sanitization** helps protect against SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **CORS handling** ensures that only trusted domains can interact with our APIs.

We encourage developers to regularly review and update their security practices. Check out the [PHP Security Best Practices](https://phptherightway.com/#security), [PHP Security Docs](https://www.php.net/manual/en/security.php), and [PHP Type Safety Topic](https://thephp.cc/topics/type-safety) resources for more information.
